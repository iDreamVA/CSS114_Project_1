## Gaussian Elimination with Partial Pivoting
numerical method used to solve a system of linear equations
Ax=b by transforming the matrix into an upper triangular form, followed by back substitution.

---
## Gauss–Jordan Elimination 
transforms the matrix into Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) 
and obtains the solution directly without back substitution.
